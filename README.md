# SFML-chunck-manager
Chunck manager made in SFML 3.0.0, its a bit glitchy but I cant find the problem. If ENTER is not pressed, the program will draw only the chucnk that the player is in, else it will draw all chuncks.
There are 2 structures(lake and grass), other can be added easy.
If custom strucutres are added the generateStructure function needs to be modified aswell.
